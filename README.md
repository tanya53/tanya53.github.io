    Purpose of Site
    Welcome to Peep Power.  This site is an illustration of what a person can learn by
    taking numerous free on-line classes from Coursera, Udacity, edX , freecodecamp and
    many other on-line tutorials.  I was loyal to them all until they started to charge
    a fee to gain access to all the material, I understand their business plan, but I have
    an education budget of zero.  So now my loyalty is to edX and freecodecamp.  This
    site illustrates what I have learned after many, many hours or thousands of life moments.
    I would like to say it was fun, which it was, but at times it was some of the most
    frustrating hours of my life, just ask my family members who had to deal with me.
      
    The peeps were a creation after my children moved out of the house and got on with
    their own lives. There now was no one to blame for the light left on, using the
    last of the milk, the general mess, so the Peeps came to the rescue.  I always said
    I lived in my own universe, one that periodically intersected with the universes of
    others.  To have content for this project this universe has become the peeps and they
    are continuing to evolve, as more content is needed.
 
    The pages were designed using HTML5, scss and javascript.  I also used normalize.scss to
    insure a common starting point, autoprefixer, and gulp.  All the html and css code was
    validated using W3's validator.  I used colorsafe.co to help select th color palatte for
    the site.  The accessiblity was checked using wave.webaim.org.   The static part of the site
    is hosted on github.  The dynamic pages will be hosted on heroku. The server code uses nodejs
    and express.  Handlebars was used for the templates for the dynamic web pages. Several
    of the pages uses MongoDB and access various APIs. All the code in located on
    https://github.com/tanya53/tanya53.github.io.  All the photos without credits were taken
    by myself or by other members of my family.
